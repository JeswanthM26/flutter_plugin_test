## ðŸ›  Platform Support

- âœ… Android
- âœ… iOS

## ðŸ§  Best Practices
### âœ… Do:

- Trigger the in-app review flow after a user has experienced enough of your app to provide useful feedback.
- Allow enough time in the session before prompting
- Ensure the prompt isnâ€™t shown repeatedly

### ðŸš« Don't:

- Do not prompt the user excessively for a review. This approach helps minimize user frustration and 
  limit API usage 
- Show repeatedly within short time
- Block user flows waiting for a review response
